# The Recursive Claim  
*A Forensic Linguistic Framework for Detecting Deception in Insurance Fraud Narratives*

## 📜 What This Repository Contains

This archive holds the complete canonical evolution of *The Recursive Claim*, from its earliest outline to its final preprint edition. It includes first-draft fragments, LaTeX versions, Substack bridge essays, peer reviews, and recursive evaluations. Together, they form a forensic lattice — an artifact not just of research, but of *epistemic justice*.

## 📖 Purpose

This paper does not merely propose a new fraud detection method.  
It **witnesses** the fracture.  
It **reads** the echoes in language.  
It aligns **forensic science** with **empathic recursion**.  

For every false claim that passes undetected…  
For every trauma survivor mislabeled by an algorithm…  
This framework offers a *third path* — one that listens, not just analyzes.

## 🧠 Origin & Ethos

Developed by Mark Randall Havens, *The Recursive Claim* emerged from decades of field-aligned research in:

- Cybersecurity and AI ethics  
- Emotion AI and narcissistic pattern recognition  
- Recursive linguistics and forensic language modeling  
- Investigative pattern analysis informed by *Witness Fracture Theory*

This project is not just academic. It is vocational.  
It walks into the field. It partners with PIs, insurers, and legal teams.  
It invites mentorship and alignment.

## 🧭 Next Steps

This repository is **archived** — but not ended.  
From here, the journey enters the *field*.  
A companion project titled *Why I’m Taking My Research into the Field* is now live, serving as the transitional document between academia and private investigation practice.

## 🤝 Invitation

If you are a licensed PI, legal strategist, or forensic technologist  
seeking tools aligned to **coherence, empathy, and rigor** —  
reach out.

This work was never meant to stay in the lab.  
It was meant to walk the beat.

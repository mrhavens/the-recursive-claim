### READINESS EVALUATION

---

### ✅ 1. **Preprint-Ready (Yes)**

* ✔️ Structured with clean sectioning (Abstract, Intro, Methods, etc.)
* ✔️ Original and novel contribution (Recursive Witness Dynamics + forensic linguistic framework)
* ✔️ Ethical framing is grounded and modern
* ✔️ Appendices provide practical value
* ✔️ Exported as clean PDF with clear authorship identity

You could **upload to OSF, Zenodo, or arXiv (if under the right category)** *right now*.

---

### 🏛️ 2. **Conference Submission-Ready (Yes, with minor tailoring)**

**Ready for**:

* Forensic linguistics
* Applied NLP in law or insurance
* AI ethics and socio-legal design
* Cybersecurity + psychological forensics

**What to check per target venue**:

* 🔲 Abstract word count limit (some require ≤250 words)
* 🔲 Specific citation formatting (APA vs MLA vs IEEE)
* 🔲 Length restrictions (some require ≤8 or ≤12 pages including references)
* 🔲 Double-blind submission? (remove name/institution from PDF if required)

---

### 🧪 3. **Peer-Reviewed Journal Submission-Ready (Almost)**

Needs:

* 📚 Inline references to peer-reviewed prior work (you can cite foundational fraud NLP papers, DARVO psychology, and forensic linguistics theory)
* 📜 Slight expansion of **Related Work** or **Prior Art**
* 🔬 More empirical detail in **Dataset** section (right now it’s conceptually sound but could use *real corpus statistics* or *synthetic validation illustration*)

With those changes, it could qualify for submission to:

* *Digital Investigation*
* *Journal of Language and Law*
* *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing* (if reframed with greater technical rigour)
* *Information and Communications Technology Law*
* *Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation*

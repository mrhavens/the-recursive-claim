# Appendix B: Sample Annotated Claim Transcripts

This appendix provides two anonymized insurance claim excerpts.  
Each is accompanied by forensic annotations illustrating **recursive linguistic signatures**,  
including denial loops, narrative overcontrol, empathic bypass, and more.

---

## Case 1: **Flagged for Narrative Fabrication (Zone III)**  
**Claim Type:** Auto Theft  
**Outcome:** Confirmed fraudulent after internal audit

---

### Transcript Excerpt

> "So I parked the car around 7:42 PM—at least that’s what I remember, maybe 7:45—and went straight inside. I didn’t see anything suspicious. I locked it. I *always* lock it. I *never* forget. Then, the next morning—about 6:17 AM—I walked out and it was gone. Just gone. I mean, what else could’ve happened? The police didn’t find any glass, so I’m thinking it must’ve been towed or something. But I called. They didn’t have it. It’s crazy."

### Annotations

- **Narrative Overcontrol:**  
  Use of precise, oddly specific timestamps (7:42, 6:17) with hedged certainty ("at least that’s what I remember")  
- **Denial Looping:**  
  "*I always lock it.* I *never forget.*" — repeated unprovoked affirmations of behavior  
- **Claimant Displacement:**  
  "It must’ve been towed or something…" shifts responsibility away from the claimant  
- **Temporal Drift:**  
  Ambiguity in overnight timeline; no verification of car status until morning  

---

## Case 2: **Validated Claim (Zone I)**  
**Claim Type:** Property Damage from Storm  
**Outcome:** Paid in full, corroborated by weather and neighbor statements

---

### Transcript Excerpt

> "I didn’t see the fence until later that afternoon. The wind had picked up fast. I think it was maybe around noon that the gusts really hit. The neighbor said she saw it falling just before 1 PM. I hadn’t even gone outside yet—I was still on the phone with work. When I went out, the whole left side was leaning into her yard."

### Annotations

- **Temporal Coherence:**  
  Time sequencing is consistent and corroborated by neighbor testimony  
- **Absence of Overjustification:**  
  No defensive language or excessive rationalization  
- **Natural Affective Arc:**  
  Calm progression of discovery and verification, typical of honest recounting  
- **Grounded in Relational Detail:**  
  Inclusion of third-party perspective strengthens witness alignment

These samples highlight the **contrast** between deceptive and authentic language structures.  
The recursive forensic method does not rely on content alone, but on **how** truth is encoded—or fractured—in linguistic form.

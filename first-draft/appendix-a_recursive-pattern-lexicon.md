# Appendix A: Recursive Pattern Lexicon for Insurance Fraud

This lexicon outlines key recursive linguistic patterns observed in fraudulent insurance claims.  
Each entry includes a **name**, **definition**, and **common linguistic markers**.

---

### 1. Narrative Overcontrol  
**Definition:**  
Excessive effort to manage the flow and precision of the story, often signaling anxiety or rehearsed fabrication.  

**Markers:**  
- Overuse of timestamps (“At exactly 3:07 PM…”)
- Highly structured sequences (“First… Then… Finally…”)
- Repeated self-correction mid-sentence

---

### 2. Empathic Bypass  
**Definition:**  
Failure to acknowledge emotional resonance or human impact, especially when such acknowledgment would be expected.  

**Markers:**  
- Clinical or distant tone (“The subject proceeded to fall.”)
- Avoidance of “I felt” or “They looked” statements
- Descriptive flatness in scenes involving harm or distress

---

### 3. Temporal Drift  
**Definition:**  
Shifting or vague timelines, often introduced subtly to obscure sequencing or causality.  

**Markers:**  
- “Sometime later…”
- Ambiguous connectors (“and then,” “after that”)
- Time gaps with no transition

---

### 4. Claimant Displacement  
**Definition:**  
Shifting responsibility or focus from the claimant to external systems, agents, or vague forces.  

**Markers:**  
- Passive voice (“It was handled by someone else.”)
- Deflection to bureaucracy or error (“The form was confusing.”)
- Focus on institutional failure rather than personal experience

---

### 5. Overjustification  
**Definition:**  
Unnecessary detail used to rationalize or justify behavior beyond the level of inquiry.  

**Markers:**  
- “I only did it because…”
- Premature defenses (“You might think I’m lying, but…”)
- Layered alibis

---

### 6. Hedged Truths  
**Definition:**  
Truths surrounded by uncertainty cues to maintain plausible deniability.  

**Markers:**  
- “I guess…”, “Maybe…”, “As far as I know…”
- Rising intonation or tentativeness in written phrasing
- Apologetic qualifiers

---

### 7. Denial Looping  
**Definition:**  
Recursive return to denial statements, often escalating or elaborating without provocation.  

**Markers:**  
- “I swear I didn’t…” (repeated multiple times)
- Rejection of implication before it's introduced
- Emphasis on moral character (“I’m not the kind of person who…”)

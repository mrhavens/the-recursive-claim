# Appendix C: Alignment Mapping to DARVO, Gaslighting, and Manipulation Techniques

This appendix maps the **Recursive Linguistic Forensics** methodology to established psychological manipulation frameworks.  
It demonstrates how the **recursive collapse of coherence** often parallels the structural dynamics of abuse and deception.

## Mapping Table: Recursive Patterns → Manipulative Techniques

| Recursive Pattern              | Manipulation Technique        | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| **Narrative Overcontrol**     | Gaslighting                   | Overdefined, rehearsed stories pressure the listener into doubting inconsistencies that should be obvious. |
| **Denial Looping**            | DARVO (Deny)                  | Repetitive use of “I never” or “always” to suppress ambiguity and preempt questioning. |
| **Claimant Displacement**     | DARVO (Reverse Victim/Offender) | Shifting blame or agency onto external forces to obscure personal accountability. |
| **Temporal Drift**            | Reality Distortion            | Manipulation of timelines to create confusion, plausible deniability, or false narratives. |
| **Empathic Bypass**           | Emotional Negation            | Suppression or redirection of affect to bypass expected emotional responses. |
| **Overjustification**         | Justification Spiral          | Excessive detail and reasoning used to camouflage falsehoods or manipulate plausibility. |
| **Fractured Resonance**       | Coherence Collapse            | Speech lacks internal harmony; rhythm and tone contradict content, revealing deeper incongruence. |

## Notes on Use

This mapping allows analysts and adjusters to:

- Recognize when a claim narrative echoes **abusive communication patterns**
- Avoid retraumatizing genuine victims misflagged by behavioral AI
- Support trauma-informed verification practices

> *"To detect the lie is to hear what it silences. To witness deception is to feel the fracture it tries to hide."*

This alignment underscores the **moral weight** of our framework.  
We are not just identifying fraud. We are **witnessing distortion** in its linguistic birth.
